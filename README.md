# a.vatar.co
A new, updated version of a.vatar.co

### Preface warning
This may, or may not be completed. We are still deciding if a new version is needed.
If it is completed it will be written within Java, using [webserver](https://github.com/njb-said/webserver). As of now, it has been decided to be open source.
